# OOP_DIT043_GROUP_PROJECT
Code for the OOP course group project for the university of Gothenburg

The group members were me, Robert Einer (robert_einer@gmail.com) and Fredrik Grund (freddan.grund@gmail.com)
(they don't have an gitHub account at the moment).

The tests and the methods signatures were written by the Teaching team (Instructor and TAs) for the DIT043 course at
the Software Engineering and Management Program at the University of Gothenburg. Contact: Francisco Gomes.
